## Salary Prediction for Data Science roles

Data science combines multiple disciplines like math, statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning which helps to uncover actionable insights hidden in data. According to the Harvard Business Review (2022), the amount of data, analytics, and AI in business and society seem unlikely to decline, therefore, data scientist jobs will only continue to grow in its importance. Hence, knowing the factors that affect the salary estimate will be beneficial for professionals working in this field. 

For this particular project, the data used was created by pickesueat published in GitHub, which contained scrapped Glassdoor data from June 2020. The dataset was scrapped having in consideration four different job categories: Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Business Analyst. Overall, the dataset had a total of 26,980 observations and 15 different features.

The project contains the exploratory data analysis of the different features and their impact on the target variable. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed. Machine learning regression techniques were employed and a comparative study was performed on the following models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging Regressor, ADABoost and XGBoost) to forecast salaries across a spectrum of data science positions.

There are 2 folders in the github repo, namely Code and Report.

Code folder contains the code file code.py of the project. The code file contains the exploratory data analysis done on the dataset, along with the data preprocessing and the modelling codes.

Report folder contains the Final_Report.pdf file that has all the information about the project.
